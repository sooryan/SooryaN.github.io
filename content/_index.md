I'm Soorya, a programmer who hopes to make software to
bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds and
allow people to express themselves better. Welcome to this
wholly unremarkable piece of the internet that I happen to
own.
<br>
<br>
I'm currently helping make cars drive themselves with
Motional, the Hyundai-Aptiv JV in Singapore. Before that, I
did my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at NIT
Trichy, graduating in 2018.
<br>
<br>
I enjoy reading, art, music, and contemplating the meaning
of life. I believe that without objective morality,
everything is permissible, so sometimes I pour milk first
and then add the cereal. One of the goals of the site is to
encourage me to consume less and make more. You can check
out some of my art and (as of yet non-existent) writing
